# JPMorgan-Chase-Virtual-Internship
My repository for work done on the JPMorgan&amp;Chase Virtual Internship

Disclaimer: Most of the resources here are boilerplate code from the internship, my tasks were to augment the code to do the ff:
1) Provide Data Visualization for Traders - Use Perspective to create the chart for the trader's dashboard
2) Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization
3) Interface with a stock price data feed - Interface with a stock price data feed and set up your system for analysis of the data
